# Project Title

Creating a Token in solidity

## Description

This repository contains a Solidity contract that implements a basic token contract with minting and burning functionality.
The contract allows for the creation and destruction of tokens, maintaining a mapping of addresses to token balances.
It includes public variables to store important details about the token, such as the token name, abbreviation, and total supply.
The mint function increases the total supply and the sender's balance, while the burn function reduces the total supply and deducts tokens from the sender's balance.
Safety measures are in place to ensure the sender's balance is sufficient for burning tokens.
This contract serves as a foundation for token-related functionality and can be easily integrated into decentralized applications.
Contributions and feedback are welcome.

## Getting Started

Clone these repo or download zip to get the .sol files  

### Installing

This has .sol files which can be deployed on any online IDE like remix by adding to their template folder

### Executing program

How to run the program
* First set compile version then press compile
* Then then go to execution tab and press deploy 
* Now smart contract is deployed now go click on it to access fns and variables 
* You can run these and see results in the terminal 

## Help

Any advise for common problems or issues
* Avoid using brave
